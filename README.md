DESCRIPTION: In this task, I worked on a project to check the feelings or opinions in text, called sentiment analysis.I used Python along with some helpful tools for working
with data and understanding language.,pandas for working with data, nltk for language processing, and textblob for finding the sentiment.

I started by installing the required tools and then loaded my dataset from a CSV file. I looked at the first few entries to understand what type of text it had.
The file contained different sentences written by people along with their moods, like positive or negative.I then created a way for the computer to read each sentence 
and decide if it was positive, negative, or neutral, based on the feeling of the words. The computer went through all the sentences in the file and
added a new column showing the result for each one.

After completing the analysis, I saved the updated data into a new file so it could be used later for study or comparison.From this task, I learned how to work with large 
amounts of data, check the mood of sentences, and save results into a file. It also helped me understand how computers can read and understand human 
language in a simple way
